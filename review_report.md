## Security Improvements

### CSRF Protection
- All critical forms now have CSRF tokens
- Tokens are generated securely using `random_bytes()`
- Validation uses `hash_equals()` for timing attack prevention

### Input Validation
- Email format validation
- Username length validation
- Password length validation
- File type validation for uploads
- File size validation for uploads

### Upload Security
- Removed reliance on POST data for user identification
- Use session-based user ID for security
- Proper file type and size validation
- Secure file naming with `uniqid()`

## Database Schema Status

### Current Schema
- ✅ All tables properly defined
- ✅ Location tracking fields added to shuttles table
- ✅ Foreign key constraints in place
- ✅ Indexes for performance
- ✅ Sample data included

### Required Actions
To apply the updated schema, run:
```sql
-- Run the complete schema.sql file
mysql -u root -p < database/schema.sql
```

## Remaining Considerations

### Environment Setup
1. **Database**: Ensure MySQL is running and schema is applied
2. **File Permissions**: Ensure `uploads/profile_pictures/` is writable
3. **PHP Configuration**: Ensure file uploads are enabled

### Configuration
- All configuration is in `backend/config.php`
- No new environment variables needed
- Database credentials may need updating for production

### Performance
- Database indexes are in place for location queries
- CSRF tokens are generated efficiently
- File uploads are properly validated

## Recommendations for Production

1. **Security**
   - Enable HTTPS and set `session.cookie_secure = 1`
   - Implement rate limiting for login attempts
   - Add IP-based blocking for failed attempts

2. **Monitoring**
   - Monitor error logs regularly
   - Set up database backup procedures
   - Monitor file upload directory size

3. **Performance**
   - Consider Redis for session storage
   - Implement database connection pooling
   - Add caching for frequently accessed data

## Conclusion

The OrangeRoute project has been successfully reviewed and repaired. All critical issues have been addressed with minimal, non-destructive changes. The application now has:

- ✅ Complete security with CSRF protection
- ✅ Proper input validation
- ✅ Fixed missing files and broken links
- ✅ Improved error handling
